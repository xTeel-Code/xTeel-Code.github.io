## Going Off Grid

### General Practices
- Use a burner phone or non-networked device.
- Disable location and Bluetooth when not needed.
- Be aware of metadata in media and files.

## Burner Phones

### Variant 1: Classic Button Phone
- Buy a classic phone (no GPS, no apps).
- Pay in cash, in-person.
- Buy prepaid SIM (different store, cash, no ID).
- Disable voicemail.
- Power off when unused.
- Use for outgoing communication only.
- Do not store real names.
- Rules: No use at home, keep in Faraday pouch.
- Extreme case: destroy flash and SIM physically (drill, melt, etc.).

### Variant 2: Cheap Android + Custom ROM
- Buy cheap Android (e.g., Motorola G52). Avoid iPhone/Samsung.
- Flash GrapheneOS or CalyxOS.
- Never use your home Wi-Fi.
- Don't insert personal SIM.
- Use cash-prepaid SIM.
- Only install essentials: Signal, Session, SimpleX.
- Use PIN – No biometrics.
- Keep GPS, BT, Wi-Fi off unless needed.

### Extra Paranoia Tips
- Wrap in tinfoil if no Faraday pouch.
- Don't use near personal devices – triangulation is real.
- Don't cloud sync or backup.
- No identifying photos.
- If compromised: nuke (drill, microwave, electrocute).

## Non-network Devices

### Examples
- Old laptops with Wi-Fi/Ethernet disabled.
- Air-gapped PCs (used in military, cold wallets).
- MP3 players, cameras, retro consoles.

### Setup
- Wipe data completely.
- Install a secure OS: Tails, Whonix, Qubes, Alpine.
- Remove or disable Wi-Fi card (BIOS or physical removal).
- Never connect to any network.
- Only use trusted USBs – check for hidden files.

## Awareness of Metadata
- Use ExifTool to inspect or remove metadata.
  - Install: https://exiftool.org/install.html
  - Remove: `exiftool -all:all= -r /path/to/files/`
  - View: `exiftool /path/to/file`

## Tips and Tricks
- Change IP and MAC addresses regularly.
- Use multiple aliases and devices.
- Avoid repeating patterns (same AP, time, message format).
- Don’t link or reuse accounts.
- Use password manager (Bitwarden).
- Don’t reuse photos/text – avoid reverse search.

## Security Myths
- VPN ≠ Anonymity – It hides your IP but not your identity.
- Incognito Mode ≠ Private – It doesn’t stop trackers or hide activity from your ISP.
- Burner SIMs are trackable – If patterns are reused or locations overlap.

## Levels of Paranoia
- Basic – Signal, ProtonMail, DuckDuckGo.
- Intermediate – Burner phones, non-networked devices.
- Advanced – Air-gapped systems, no online presence, physical data destruction.
